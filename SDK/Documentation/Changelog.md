# VPNKit Changelog

## VPNKit 7.2.0

### New Items
- Added `VPNOpenVPNSettings` class which holds port, protocol types, etc under `VPNConfiguration`. Refer to [VPNOpenVPNSettings](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/VPNOpenVPNSettings.md).
- Added OpenVPN support for iOS using Network Extension. Refer to [OpenVPN+NE Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/OpenVPN+NE%20Implementation.md).
- Added OpenVPN support for macOS using Network Extension. Refer to [OpenVPN+NE Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/OpenVPN+NE%20Implementation.md).
- Implemented OpenVPN handshake update functionality. Refer to [Handshake Update Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/Handshake%20Update%20Implementation.md).
- Added a `quantumResistanceEnabled` flag to `WireGuardAdapterConfiguration` to toggle the quantum-resistant transition. Default is true, meaning quantum resistance is enabled.
- Added an `allowDisconnectOnQuantumResistanceFailure` flag to `WireGuardAdapterConfiguration` to control whether the VPN disconnects if the post-connect quantum-resistant transition fails. Default is false, which preserves the existing classical WireGuard session. This flag has only effect when `quantumResistanceEnabled` is set to true.
- Updated OpenVPN from v2.4 to v2.6.
- Added the `OSSystemExtensionsWorkspaceObserver` for OpenVPN and WireGuard support on macOS 15.1 and later.
- Added a `clientManagesSystemExtension` flag to `OpenVPNAdapterConfiguration` indicating that OpenVPN system extension installation is managed by the macOS client application using Apple APIs.
- Added new `disconnect()` method at `OVPacketTunnelProvider` to terminate the VPN connection. (Intended to use on macOS only)
- Added new `bypassAllTraffic()` method at `OVPacketTunnelProvider` to bypass all traffic from the VPN connection.
- Added new `tunnelCancelled(reason) (3005)` handshake error (OpenVPN TCP only). Raised after the SDK invokes `cancelTunnelWithError(...)` because the tunnel was stopped externally (OS, another VPN being activated, system termination, etc.). The `reason` associated value carries the raw log line for diagnostics. This notification is informational and intended for logging or user notification purposes only. When Connect-On-Demand is enabled, the VPN will reconnect automatically once internet connectivity is restored. When Connect-On-Demand is disabled, this cancellation is expected and the VPN will remain disconnected. Refer to [Handshake Update Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/Handshake%20Update%20Implementation.md).
- Added new `captivePortalLikely (3006)` handshake error for WireGuard and OpenVPN. Surfaced once per episode when repeated handshake failures within the post-roam window strongly suggest the current network requires HTTP sign-in (captive portal). OpenVPN additionally pauses its internal reconnect loop while suspected; both protocols clear the classification on a successful handshake or a fresh network path change. When `isKillSwitchEnabled` is `true`, the manager's `includeAllNetworks` flag must be cleared so iOS can present its captive sheet - on macOS by calling `self.disconnect(...)` from inside `vpnHandshakeUpdateDetected(_:)`, on iOS / tvOS by signaling the app target and having the app call its own disconnect API. Refer to [Handshake Update Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/Handshake%20Update%20Implementation.md).
- Added new `isKillSwitchEnabled` property on `OVPacketTunnelProvider` and `WGPacketTunnelProvider` reflecting the active `includeAllNetworks` value from the tunnel protocol configuration. Intended to be read from `vpnHandshakeUpdateDetected(_:)` to decide whether `captivePortalLikely` recovery requires clearing the kill switch (via `self.disconnect(...)` on macOS, or via an app-side disconnect call on iOS / tvOS).
- Added new `notifyRoamingOnce: Bool` property on `OVPacketTunnelProvider` and `WGPacketTunnelProvider` to control `.roaming` event delivery. Defaults to `true` (the SDK emits at most one `.roaming` notification per roam episode - episode boundary = successful handshake, fresh network path change, or tunnel start/stop). Set to `false` to receive a `.roaming` event on every handshake retry inside the post-roam window (diagnostics, telemetry, or aggressive recovery UI).
- Enabled OpenVPN UDP **session floating** (link rebinding) by default. Network path changes that previously required a full TLS / key renegotiation are now recovered by rebinding the existing session to the new socket. It dramatically reducing recovery latency on Wi-Fi to cellular swaps and eliminating the visible "tunnel restarts on every path change" UX.
- Added `VPNQuantumResistenceFailedNotification` and `statusQuantumResistenceFailed` for WireGuard quantum resistance failures. The notification includes an `NSError` with `VPNKitQuantumResistanceError` codes in the 6000 range and failure detail keys for city, hostname, timestamp, and reason.
- Added `systemExtensionStatus` to `VPNAPIManager` and `VPNConnectionAdapterProtocol` to report the current adapter's system extension state on macOS 15.1 and later.
- Added `VPNSystemExtensionDisabled` to `Errors.h` to report an error when the client attempts to connect while the system extension is disabled.

### Removed Items
- Removed `VPNProtocolOpenVPN_UDP` and `VPNProtocolOpenVPN_TCP` VPNProtocols.
- Removed legacy code related to OpenVPN Command Line Tool.
- Removed the unused AES-256-CBC cipher from the OpenVPN client configuration.

### Improvements
- Changed URLSession cache policy to disable cache writes
- Improved unexpected API response handling on login endpoint to return an error and prevent false positives.
- Fix OpenVPN doublehop connection issue.
- Fix OpenVPN crash issue on macOS during migration to Network Extension support.
- OpenVPN connection will be failed when user account isn't active.
- Fixed IPSec connection issue.
- Fixed `loginWithAccessToken:refreshToken:` (token-based login) no longer reports success when the underlying network request fails.
- Fixed no internet available after connect to OpenVPN with 8080 port.
- Updated SDK APIs from v3.5 to v3.6.
- Fixed repeated VPN profile re-approval when multiple macOS users shared the same VPN account.
- Fixed OpenVPN connection not updating status change.
- Fixed `VPNUpdateConfigurationFailedNotification` on OpenVPN profile installation failure.
- Improved WireGuard and OpenVPN handshake failure classification - `HandshakeError` now distinguishes `roaming` (3002), `staleSession` (3003), and `handshakeTimeout` (3004). Refer to [Handshake Update Implementation](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/Handshake%20Update%20Implementation.md).
- Made `isInternetAvailable` on `OVPacketTunnelProvider` and `WGPacketTunnelProvider` reflect the live `NWPath.Status` directly instead of a log-driven cached flag. Fixes a race where a handshake failure arriving before the next path update would classify against stale state, causing real outages to be mis-classified as `.handshakeTimeout` or `.roaming` instead of `.internetUnreachable`. The property is now strictly `true` only when the active path status is `.satisfied`; `.requiresConnection` and `.unsatisfied` both read as `false`. The classifier inside `vpnHandshakeUpdateDetected(_:)` uses the same live source of truth.
- MTU set based on the OpenVPN network tunnel overhead instead device compatibility.
- Fixed issue of Objective-C class name collision originating from Bucket, Usage and Plan and renamed them to VPNV3Bucket, VPNV3Usage, VPNV3Plan inside VPNV3APIAdapter.framework.

### Improvements
- Enhanced `IKEv2` error handling to gracefully manage `VPNServerUnhealthyError` and `VPNInvalidServerError`
- When connecting to a VPN server, if the connection fails with `VPNServerUnhealthyError` or `VPNInvalidServerError`, that server is now automatically removed to prevent future connection attempts to unhealthy or invalid servers. See [Fetch](https://github.com/wlvpn/ConsumerVPN-macOS/blob/main/SDK/Documentation/Fetch.md#refetching-updated-data) for details on refetching updated data.
- Fixed an issue where the SDK was unable to retrieve stored keychain values when the iOS device was locked.

The implementer needs to re-authenticate the user.
  - `Password based authentication` - Upon token invalidation/expiration, the SDK will attempt to re-authenticate the user using the saved email and password. If the authentication fails, will send `VPNLogoutSucceededNotification` notification which has `VPNReauthenticationFailed` error as an  notification object. The implementer needs to re-authenticate the user.
