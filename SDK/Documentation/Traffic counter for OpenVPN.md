# Traffic counter for OpenVPN

- Data traffic can be accessed through notification `VPNNetworkMonitorUpdateNotification` at `statusNetworkMonitorUpdate` method
- Notifies the receiver about incoming and outgoing network data used. Includes a bandwidth object with this   information.
- `object` property holds type `VPNBandwidthModel`
-  User have to override `statusNetworkMonitorUpdate` method and accesss the data.
-  `Note`: 
    macOS app never suspends and they can access data traffic continuously. But in iOS if app is suspended no data traffic will be received

        // get the lastUpload/download, totalUpload/download in string form
        let lastUploadString = convertBytesSizeToString(dataLastUploadSize)
        let lastDownloadString = convertBytesSizeToString(dataLastDownloadSize)
    }
